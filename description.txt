Thaumaturgy adds an upgraded work bench, the Thaumatrestle, which is sold by a new town NPC, the Thaumaturge, a haunted academic who wants to put his skills to use. The Thaumatrestle can be used to break down fallen stars and mana crystals into power sources - auric shards and auric cores - which can then be used to craft, shape, transform, brew, and change objects in any way you can imagine.
