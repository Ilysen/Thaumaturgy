# Thaumaturgy
A mod for Terraria including magic and a doomed scholar.

Thaumaturgy adds an upgraded work bench, the Thaumatrestle, which is sold by a new town NPC, the Thaumaturge, a haunted academic who wants to put his skills to use. The Thaumatrestle can be used to break down fallen stars and mana crystals into power sources - auric shards and auric cores - which can then be used to craft, shape, transform, brew, and change objects in any way you can imagine.

The Thaumaturge will move in after defeating the Eye of Cthulhu. They are also eligibile from the get-go if the world is in Expert mode. They sell the Thaumatrestle for 1 gold, and pale stars for 10 silver. Pale stars can be used to ineffeciently make auric shards and auric cores, but have none of the other uses that fallen stars do. Once hardmode starts, the Thaumaturge will sell actual fallen stars for 25 silver instead.

Examples of recipes added by Thaumaturgy use include transmuting 25 crimstone into 25 ebonstone with an auric shard, creating a cloud in a bottle with 1 bottle, 20 clouds, and 3 auric shards, or replicating a piece of wood into 75 wood with an auric shard. All recipes are made at a Thaumatrestle, and most require a specialized focus nearby, which you can also purchase from the Thaumaturge.

A mod like Recipe Browser is highly recommended!

# Changelog

### Aug. 10, 2019

#### 1.0.18.4

* Renamed alchemical brass to starbrass ~~because it sounds cooler~~ to differentiate it from Minecraft's Thaumcraft.
* Added the Starbrass armor set, an early pre-Hardmode magic armor set made of starbrass and auric ingredients.
* Added the Auromechanical armor set, an upgraded version of Starbrass armor with stronger effects.
* Fixed a bug where the Thaumaturge wouldn't sell to you if you'd beaten the Lunatic Cultist but not the Moon Lord.
* The Falling Flame can now also be worn as an accessory to boost max move speed! Its original use still exists.

### Aug. 7, 2019

#### 1.0.18.3

* Added the Potion of Soothing Embers and its elixir counterpart, the Elixir of Utter Calm, which hugely reduce enemy spawns.

#### 1.0.18.2

* The Kaleidoscopic Focus now functions as a Replication Focus. The Celestial Focus now also functions as both a Kaleidoscopic Focus and Replication Focus. In short: upgraded versions keep their recipes. You don't need one of each now.
* The Celestial Focus now requires one of reach lunar fragment.
* Added the Universal Focus, which functions as every focus. Craft it with all three foci and several auric cores.d
* The Thaumaturge now sells a new ingredient, Alchemical Brass, after the defeat of the Eater of Worlds/Brain of Cthulhu. Use it to make new stuff.
* Added the Aural Tether, which lets you mark a point, then later recall to it. Synthesise it with a magic mirror, alchemical brass, and auric cores.
* The Terran Bore now requires alchemical brass instead of meteorite, and has been recolored.
* The Auric Gunshell now requires alchemical brass, and has a new sprite.
* Added the Aura Aegis, which is synthesized by combining the Shield of Cthulhu and the Ankh Shield and provides both of their effects, as well as granting immunity to more debuffs.
* The Aurelian Harness can be stabilized using souls of flight, upgrading them to roughly on par with the Leaf Wings.
* Gave Ethereal Bullets (from the Auric Gunshell) fancy particles.
* Added the Falling Flame consumable item, which hurls you far into the distance. Craft several with a few fallen stars, a torch, and an auric core.
* The taumatrestle now functions as a table in NPC housing.
* Minor grammar changes.

#### 1.0.17.2

* Yes, Ava, you did in fact include the Auric Gunshell changelog. This patch removes that duplicate changelog. >>

#### 1.0.17.1

* Updated the homepage to the new forum thread. Yes, it's really me!

#### 1.0.17.0

* Added recipes for the endless quiver and endless musket pouch so that they're obtainable pre-Hardmode. They don't break balance!
* Added the Bind-Shackle accessory, which increases mining speed.
* Added the Auric Gunshell ammo item, which functions in the vein of the musket pouch, but higher damage and piercing at the cost of no knockback.
* Added the Pathfinder's Lamp accessory, which provides a small amount of light when worn.
* **Note:** Both of the following changes are made in an effort to balance out the power of elixirs and draughts. Both are currently almost entirely money-gated. In order to preevent it from just being a mindless material grind, the actual material costs are fairly low for each of the items; it's mostly a test of "can you get these materials during this progression point."
* Added the Treated Flask material (made with Meteorite, Hellstone, and Obsidian) and added it to the recipes for flasks.
* Added the Crystal Phial material (made with Crystal Shards and Souls of Light) and added it to the recipes for draughts.
* Added the Draught of Daredevilry, which combines both draughts into one!
* Updated sprites for all elixirs and draughts to represent the new bottles.
* Reduced the cost of all flasks by replacing their auric core cost with auric shards.

#### 1.0.16.3

* Fixed a long-standing bug with foci duplicating when they're hit.

### Jul. 30, 2019

#### 1.0.16.2

* Made Thaumic Pie a bit harder to craft, owing to being infinite.

#### 1.0.16.1

* Added increased reach to the conjurer's lamp, and reduced its rarity to blue. (It looks better with its colors. Don't judge.)
* Renamed auric torches to glimmer lights.
* Added a very small mana cost to the conjurer's lamp.
* Added phoenix down.

#### 1.0.16.0

* Resprited the Slate Tablet.
* Buffed the Watery Embers potion a bit.
* Rewrote the Thaumaturge's lines.
* Removed fallen stars from the Thaumaturge's inventory - it broke balance both in vanilla and across mods. To compensate, pale stars are now much cheaper in hardmode.
* Stopped the Terran Bore from breaking into the temple.
* Made the Kaleidoscopic Focus require Pearlstone to prevent super fast rushing pre-Hardmode, breaking any semblance of balance.
