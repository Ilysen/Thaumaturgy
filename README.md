# Thaumaturgy
A mod for Terraria including magic and a doomed scholar.

Thaumaturgy adds an upgraded work bench, the Thaumatrestle, which is sold by a new town NPC, the Thaumaturge, a haunted academic who wants to put his skills to use. The Thaumatrestle can be used to break down fallen stars and mana crystals into power sources - auric shards and auric cores - which can then be used to craft, shape, transform, brew, and change objects in any way you can imagine.

The Thaumaturge will move in after defeating the Eye of Cthulhu. They are also eligibile from the get-go if the world is in Expert mode. They sell the Thaumatrestle for 1 gold, and pale stars for 10 silver. Pale stars can be used to ineffeciently make auric shards and mana crystals, but have none of the other uses that fallen stars do. Once hardmode starts, the Thaumaturge will sell actual fallen stars for the same price.

Examples of recipes added by Thaumaturgy use include transmuting 25 crimstone into 25 ebonstone with an auric shard, creating a cloud in a bottle with 1 bottle, 20 clouds, and 3 auric shards, or replicating a piece of wood into 75 wood with an auric shard. All recipes are made at a Thaumatrestle, and most require a specialized focus nearby, which you can also purchase from the Thaumaturge.

A mod like Recipe Browser is highly recommended!
